# Requirements lower bounds listed here are our best effort to keep them up to
# date but we do not test them so no guarantee of having them all correct. If
# you find any incorrect lower bounds, let us know or propose a fix.

# The order of packages is significant, because pip processes them in the order
# of appearance. Changing the order has an impact on the overall integration
# process, which may cause wedges in the gate later.
